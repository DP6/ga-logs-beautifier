# GA-beautifier-iOS

This code makes the logs provided by Fiddler proxy of the Google Analytics events coming from iOS more readable.

To run it, create a file name as "in.txt" with the decrypted logs and in a terminal run the "beautifier.py" file:

`python3 beautifier.py`

The result will be saved in the file "out.txt".

Enjoy ;D
